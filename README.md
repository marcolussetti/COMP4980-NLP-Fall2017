# Notebooks for Natural Language Processing class
## Running the Notebooks in the Cloud
To experiment with the notebooks, run them for yourself etc., you can just click the "Launch Binder" button above.
It will take you to a free hosted service that lets you experiment. Please note that any changes won't be saved to this repository or your computer.

If you want to save your results, when you are inside a notebook, use the menus: File -> Download as -> Notebook.

## Running the Notebooks on local machine
If you wish to run the notebooks locally, I would suggest just installing a scientific python distribution like [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which comes with Jupyter Notebooks and a bunch more goodies built in.

## Questions?

If you have any questions, can't get things to run or whatever, just open an [issue](https://github.com/marcolussetti/COMP4980-NLP-Fall2017/issues) or flag me down in person.
